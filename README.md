# Active-Multiple
An active Multiple Module with chained units by switched jacks

The Active Multiple is good for pitch CV and other sensitive stuff. You can perfectly use it for Audio!
No more Voltage drop when Multing!

The three 1 to to 2 Mults are chained so that you can either use them as:
3x  1 to 2
1x  1 to 4   and   1x  1 to 2
1x  1 to 6

however, you can chain them differently if you want by changing the circuit!

Have Fun!
